Codes for weighted K-mer counting method

*** These source codes have not been optimized for efficient execution yet ***

1. Bias function should be calculated to model the amount of bias along GC proportion in the genome using BiasFunction.py
2. K-mer counting source code (NormalizedKmer.py) by weighting using bias function.
